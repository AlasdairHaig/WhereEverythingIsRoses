WhereEverythingIsRoses
======================

A RPG based off a book written by my sister. I planned it to be tile-scrolling with a top-down view. It should be very elaborate.
I was going to write it in Java for its cross-platform capability. I was planning on it to be a single person game as well as a MMORPG. 
I hope to start writing code as soon as I can. I do not know a lot but hope to learn with help. I have touble with dealing with the graphics and drawing tile sheets. I want to make my 'first' program the best, though unrealistic, I am determined to do so.
